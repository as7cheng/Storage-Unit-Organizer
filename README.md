Introduction

This assignment involves the implementation of a storage unit as a sorted singly linked list. This storage unit list stores boxes of different colors and weights. It has also a capacity that can be easily expanded. These boxes must be sorted in the descending order with respect to their weight, so that the heaviest box should be at the head of the list. A graphic application has been developed to provide you with a good illustration of the different operations of this linked storage unit list.
